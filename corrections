R-squared (R2) score: 0.9664902980470405: This is a very good R-squared (R2) score. It indicates that your model explains a large amount of the variance in the data.
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 6.10069256506428: This is a relatively high MAPE. It indicates that your model is making some relatively large errors in its predictions.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0237542604858592: This is a relatively high MAE. It indicates that your model is making some relatively large errors in its predictions.
However, there are some cases where it may be better to leave bad data points in your model. For example, if you have a large dataset and the bad data points are a small percentage of the overall data, then you may be able to leave them in without significantly affecting the performance of your model.
Here are some additional things to consider when making your decision:

The size of your dataset: If you have a small dataset, then removing even a few bad data points can have a significant impact on the performance of your model.
The type of data you have: Some types of data are more sensitive to bad data points than others. For example, financial data is often very sensitive to bad data points.
The potential impact of removing the bad data points: Removing bad data points can sometimes have unintended consequences. For example, removing bad data points can sometimes lead to overfitting.
